"""
CTSM-specific test that first performs a GDD-generating run, then calls
Python code to generate the maturity requirement file. This is then used
in a sowing+maturity forced run, which finally is tested to ensure
correct behavior.

Currently only supports 10x15 and f19_g17 resolutions. Eventually, I want
this test to be able to generate its own files at whatever resolution it's
called at. Well, really, the ultimate goal would be to give CLM the files
at the original resolution (for GGCMI phase 3, 0.5Â°) and have the stream
code do the interpolation. However, that wouldn't act on harvest dates
(which are needed for generate_gdds.py). I could have Python interpolate
those, but this would cause a potential inconsistency.
